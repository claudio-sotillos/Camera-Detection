# Camera-Detection

### Overview
This repository contains the codebase and data for the research project titled "Exploring AIâ€™s Potential for Surveillance Camera Detection in Denmark." The research aims to explore the prevalence and distribution of surveillance cameras in public spaces, with a focus on the streets of Copenhagen, Denmark.

### Paper of Inspiration
Our study was inspired by a similar study called carried out in different districts in the US and some of the world's largest cities. If you want to read more about it here is the link to their paper and github repo.
- Here is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01764)
- Here is the [repo](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/surveilling-surveillance).


### Codebase
The repository includes the code used for data collection, analysis, and visualization. It leverages tools such as [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) for object detection with [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/).

### Data
The camera and road network data used in the research project are available for download in the data directory of this repository. Also there is a folder with plots, containing images of the road network, and also other plots related with the analysis of our research results. 

### Contributions and Feedback
